# Vercel SSO Removal - Manual Steps Required

## Current Status: ❌ VERCEL SSO BLOCKING ALL ACCESS

The Vercel team "Gokul's projects" has SSO protection enabled at the team level that cannot be bypassed through configuration files or CLI commands.

## Manual Steps Required in Vercel Dashboard

### Option 1: Remove SSO Protection (Recommended)

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. **Click on "Gokul's projects"** (your team name)
3. **Go to "Settings" → "Security"**
4. **Look for "Single Sign-On (SSO)" settings**
5. **DISABLE SSO** or change from "Required" to "Optional"
6. **Save changes**

### Option 2: Remove Password Protection

1. **Go to your project**: https://vercel.com/gokuls-projects-199eba9b/startup-research-clean
2. **Go to "Settings" → "Security"**
3. **Look for "Password Protection" or "Vercel Authentication"**
4. **DISABLE any protection settings**
5. **Save changes**

### Option 3: Change Team Settings

1. **In team settings**: https://vercel.com/teams/gokuls-projects-199eba9b/settings
2. **Go to "Security" tab**
3. **Disable any team-wide protection**
4. **Check "Project Protection" settings**

## Current Bypass Routes Available

Even with SSO, these routes should work once protection is removed:

### Production URLs (Currently Protected)
- Dashboard: https://startup-research-clean-fwfop8g2j-gokuls-projects-199eba9b.vercel.app/dev/dashboard
- Batch Processing: https://startup-research-clean-fwfop8g2j-gokuls-projects-199eba9b.vercel.app/dev/batch
- Admin Panel: https://startup-research-clean-fwfop8g2j-gokuls-projects-199eba9b.vercel.app/dev/admin

## Alternative Solutions

### If Vercel SSO Cannot Be Disabled:

1. **Deploy to Railway** (5 minutes setup)
2. **Deploy to Render** (Free tier available)
3. **Deploy to Heroku** (Classic choice)
4. **Deploy to DigitalOcean App Platform**

## Next Steps

1. **Try manual dashboard changes first**
2. **Test the URLs above after changes**
3. **If still blocked, consider alternative hosting**

## Local Development

Your app works perfectly locally:
- Local URL: http://localhost:3000
- All features accessible without restrictions
- Same functionality as production (minus SSO blocking)

**Note**: This issue is specific to Vercel's team-level SSO protection and is not related to your application code. Your app-level authentication and subscription-based features will work correctly once the Vercel protection is removed.
